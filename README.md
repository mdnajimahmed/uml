# UML diagram

This repo tracks my attempt to learn different types of UML diagrams, study object oriented analysis and design and some SDLC process.

- Pinning this here to discover more in future. 
- *Todo : Object oriented analysis and deisgn with hands on.*

# Reason for pause : 
- Lost interest
- Too much related to project management, seems like for more senior level(e.g architect)
- Too much documentation, I miss programming!
- Curious about something else.
