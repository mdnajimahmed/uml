# uml(Exploring the theoretical approach to SWE/SWD)
When I joined as a Senior Java Developer at PETRONAS, I realized that my role is not just coding or implementing solutions. I need to convey ideas to the team, from my fellow engineers to business users, architect, cyber security experts, devops engineers, data engineers etc. I am fully convinced by my study that using UMLs in system design and communuication is a very well structured approach to model complex systems into softwares, it teaches me a very elegant way of thinking while brainstorming on a problem and it also enormously helps to reduce techical debt by preserving the knowledge in a well documented way that is unerstandable by any team member. In this repo, I want to take a dump of my unerstanding of what I have learned, sort of a reference/cheat sheet for me. I hope this attempt will improve my understanding of the SDLC process and help me evaluate the tradeoffs we make day to day to cope up with expectations and deivery.
