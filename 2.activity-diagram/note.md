## Intro 
- This is the second diagram in the system design process flow after use case diagram
- We have a starting node and some arrow to denote flow
- We can use swimlane to denote two different actors.
- We can use fork join to denote parallel processes, basically it's a highly technical representation of the use case diagram.
- We can use decision node and merge node(exaclty oposite of decision node)
- we can use if else (guard)
