- Most frequently used UML diagram
- Three parts
    - part 01: Name - CamelCase / Noun
        - Example: EntityManager
    - Part 02: Attributes/Properties
        - Example : startedAt: Date
    - Part 03: Behavitors/ Methods/functions
        - getEntries(fromDate:Date,toDate:Date) List

- Visibility
    - `+` - means public
    - `-` - means private
    - `#` - means protected
    - `~` - package public

- Class relationship
    - Association(Aggregation vs composition) And Multiplicity(1to1,1tomany etc) (has-a relationship)
        - Object 1 refers to object 2 or takes a reference of object 2(observer pattern)
        - Simple association says, pass a copy of object 2 to object 1. Usually object 1 will just read object 2.(readonly)
        - Aggregation says, pass reference of object 2 to object 1, object 1 can change property of object 1.(read/write)
        - Composition says, object 1 will create and destroy object 2. if object 1 is destroyed then object 2 is also destroyed. composition implies ownership.(part-of relationship)
    - Generalization (is-a relationship)
        - Inheritence
    - Realization(implements behavior)
        - Interface implementation, polymorphism
    - Dependency (references) (uses relationship)
        - represents tight coupling 
        - A depends on B means if B changes then A will also need to change
        - RegistrationManagers -> scheduling algorithm
        - Often confused with association but there is a big difference. Association means the second class appears as a attribute type in the frist class whereas dependency means - second class comes as a method parameter( sometimes regualar method paramteres - that's why we use strategy pattern or sometimes constructor thats why we need ioc container!)
