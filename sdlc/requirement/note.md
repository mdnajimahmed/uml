- what value is provided by the system/feature? 
- no value = no system

Requirement gathering
- step 1: understand the scope of the project from project manager/ project stakeholder , offer alternatives
- Tactics
    - Interview
    - Brainstorming
    - Observing a job or a process
    - Requirement gathering
    - Workshop(why build it, goals and scope, high level objective)
    - mising reqruiement is catastrophic impact on project management.
    - it is a process of discovery, analyze , summerize and document.
- Steps:
    - identify stakeholders (identify the different types of users / roles of the system) , sponsors and project managers will guide here
    - identify business requirement from each type of stakeholders.
    - categorize the requirements based of different types of values such as - improtance, architecture
        - Example base of importance
            - Must feature (system will die without it, example the implementation of business flow)
            - Should feature (system will not die but if missing the process will be slowed down , example reporting)
            - Nice to have(user comfort and ease of access!)
        - Example based on architecture
            - Functional (the visible software)
            - Non functional(99% uptime)
            - Teachnical(low level design)
            - Transition(temporary, data migration)
    - requirement refinement and verification
        - Tag each and every requirement by must/should/nice to have
        - Moscow priotiziation ? what happens if the feature is not there?
    - Validation your understaning, identifying missing links
        - Mind map
        - Flowchart an swimlane(all about value?) - confirm the general understanding . swimlane is flowchart of flowchart!!!
