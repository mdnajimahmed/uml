# List 
*** RULE OF THUMB *** - BE PATIENT!!!
Use of UML
- Sketch - verify your design before implemebnting it
- Create a blueprint of what you are gonna o
- In lot of technical debt, don't know where to begin ,start reverse engineering by creating uml from the code.
## System design 
#### Main
- Class Diagram
- Use case Diagram
- Sequence Diagram
- Activity Diagram
- Deployment Diagram
- Component Diagram
- State Diagram
- Package Diagram
- Data flow diagram(Buiness modeling)
- ER Diagram
- EPC Diagram(Buiness modeling)

Kruchten's 4+1 model 
- Logical View(what makes up the system, creates abstraction to be used in the problem domain)
    - class diagram
    - state diagram
    - sequence diagram
    - communication diagram
    - object diagram
- Process view(how the processes of the system communicates with each other, we can find out what needs to happen in the system)
    - activity diagram
- Physical view (models the execution envionment of the system, infra)
    - depoyment diagram
- Development view(describes the modules or the components of the system e.g packages/libraries, gives a high level view of the architecture of the system,helps in managing the layers of the system)
    - Component diagram
    - Package iagram

- All these 4 views depend on the use case view
    - Defines the functionality of the system
    - Capture the goals of the user
    - Created by analysts, architects or even by the users
# Tools
- Visual Paradigm
    - https://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/community.jsp
    - https://online.visual-paradigm.com/diagrams/solutions/free-visual-paradigm-online/
- Draw.io
    - https://app.diagrams.net/
    - https://github.com/hediet/vscode-drawio

I am going to try to fit in eveything with Draw.io because, this tool is just awesome, it has VS code integration and online collaboration and it is my goto tool for diagrams. As part of my current project, I am also going to explore visual paradigm for UML and see how it goes.
